## [**60m**] :computer: **Activity**: Juice Shop

Being a web application with a vast number of intended security vulnerabilities, the [OWASP Juice Shop](https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/#/) intends to be the opposite of a best practice or template application for web developers: It is an awareness, training, demonstration and exercise tool for security risks in modern web applications.

The OWASP Juice Shop is an open-source project hosted by the non-profit Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and is developed and maintained by volunteers. Check out the link for more information and documentation on the project: **<https://owasp-juice.shop>**

### Setup

Set up your own instance of the [OWASP Juice Shop](https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/#/) project:

1. Install Docker Desktop using the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#supported-platforms).
1. Run the following script in your terminal:

    ```bash
    $ bash <(curl -sL https://droxey.com/ctf)
    ```
  
1. Use everything you learned in [Hacksplaining: OWASP Top 10](https://www.hacksplaining.com/owasp) to exploit your Juice Shop instance.
2. Finish a challenge? You MUST submit proof on the course [Capture the Flag](https://ctfd.droxey.com) website.
    - This website will be used to evaluate your progress and will be a significant factor determining your final grade for this course.
