## Class Assignments

We will be using [Gradescope] this term, which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. All assigned work will be submitted through [Gradescope], and assignment and exam grades will be returned through [Gradescope]. As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your [Gradescope] login is your Dominican University email, and your password can be changed at [https://gradescope.com/reset_password](https://gradescope.com/reset_password). The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.

### Challenges

Level up your web security and hacking skills by participating in up to 100 [Capture the Flag Challenges](https://ctfd.droxey.com/challenges). To get started, read the [ACS 3230 CTF Setup Guide](Lessons/OWASP.md#Setup). Students must complete `AT LEAST 33` challenges to [pass the course](#Evaluation).
